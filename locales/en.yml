      text: is an initiative launched in 2015 in Belgium, by a happy bunch of passionate coaches, for kids and teenagers to discover, experiment, learn and play with technology (robots, coding, gaming, 3D printing...). Through weekly workshops and tech camps, we foster our techies' creativity!
    intro: Our objective is to instill the maker's spirit, deconstruct to better reconstruct and understand the inner working of things. Our workshops are fun (we laugh!), hands-on (we make things) and long-lived (we take back our projects home to further develop them).

    # "Ideas for the future?"
    text: After several nice years of cohabitation with the programming school for adults Le Wagon, we have finally moved to our own premises! Our space is located at l'Extension between Saint-Gilles and Ixelles. L'Extension is a 1000sqm space that gathers artists, crafts(wo)men and entrepreneurs. The DNA of the place seduced us immediately!

        title: "Halloween Stage at Tic Tac Lab"
        description: "Boo! To celebrate Halloween in style this year, Tic Tac Lab has decided to transform its lab into... a haunted house!

  During this workshop, children will build the ideal haunted house arsenal: spiders falling from the sky, singing pumpkins, light shows, a candy cannon, ghosts telling their funny stories, cookies in the shape of witches' hats, and so on.

  This will be an opportunity for them to discover and use Tic Tac Lab's digital fabrication machines: laser cutter, 3D printer, thermoformer. Our Lego robots will also be put to good use.

  To get our creative juices flowing, we'll pay a visit to our neighbors: the Brussels Museum of Fantastic Art. It's the perfect opportunity to solve riddles and earn a diploma in witchcraft!

  And here’s a little extra you won’t want to miss: on Tuesday, October 31, the Tic Tac Lab haunted house will be open to the general public from 6pm to 9pm. You and your family can come and admire your children's creations... while enjoying a candy or two!"
