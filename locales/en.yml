    # "Ideas for the future?"
    text: After several nice years of cohabitation with the programming school for adults Le Wagon, we have finally moved to our own premises! Our space is located at l'Extension between Saint-Gilles and Ixelles. L'Extension is a 1000sqm space that gathers artists, crafts(wo)men and entrepreneurs. The DNA of the place seduced us immediately!

        their own web page, using HTML, CSS and JS languages.
        YES, programming languages, but don't fret, anybody
        can use them and we'll guide you through it.
        Also on the programme: choice and customization
